# Constraints

Boundaries around creating Ekaterina's webpage

## External

- limited timing: deadline at 16.05, 
- technologies: HTML/CSS
- we have to use UX-method Interview

## Internal: Involuntary

- didn't have enough time to learn some concepts during the previous weeks so need to catch up 
- 1st week: problems with communication in pair, 
- Figma is new to me, which took me some time to adapt

## Internal: Voluntary

- minimalistic design 
- spending a lot of time on trying to learn new things instead of enjoying coding
